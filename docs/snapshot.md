Snapshot Versions
=================

Snapshots are **untested** versions of Chunky released sporadically in order to
get feedback on upcoming features. You may choose to use snapshot versions by
selecting the "Download snapshots" check-box in the [Chunky Launcher][1]:

After enabling snapshot downloads you may check if there is a snapshot
available by clicking the "Check for Update" button. If a new snapshot is
available you will see the "Update Available!" dialog.

Warning
-------

It is not uncommon that the snapshots contain critical bugs. Please backup
your scenes in order to avoid losing important data!

Scenes created using snapshot versions of Chunky may be incompatible with
other versions of Chunky, even later proper releases!
