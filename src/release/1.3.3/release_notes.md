###Release Notes

This release adds rendering of the new Minecraft 1.8 door variants (spruce,
birch, jungle, acacia, and dark oak doors).

Unknown blocks are now invisible again. In the previous version of Chunky
unknown blocks were rendered as purple question marks. This is a debug tool
that was unintentionally left enabled.


###ChangeLog

    * Fixed rendering of the 1.8 door blocks using Birch, Spruce, Jungle,
      Dark Oak, and Acacia wood.
    * Set unknown blocks back to being invisible (instead of question marks).
    * Fixed error causing the Benchmark tool to fail horribly.
